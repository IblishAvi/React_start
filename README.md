##JSX


JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React. JSX stands for javaScript XML.

JSX allow us to write HTML element in  javascript code and place them in a DOM without any CreateElement and appendChild Method() .


## Function component

A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand.
function component is frequently used in development now a days. because of convenience .

## Class component.

A class component must include the extends React.component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions
the class component also require a render method to return HTML.
